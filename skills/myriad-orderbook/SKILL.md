# Myriad Order Book

## Overview

Use this skill for the full `myriad ob ...` workflow: discover markets, inspect depth, place orders, manage open orders, and manage positions.

Important: `myriad ob market ...` uses synthesized market-style orders derived from the live order book snapshot, not a native exchange-side market order guarantee.

Treat the order book as a production BNB Smart Chain workflow by default. Use explicit runtime overrides only when targeting a non-production deployment.

## Runtime Sanity

Before execution:

1. Verify the active order book runtime.
- Prefer explicit runtime verification over assumptions.
- Pin `--chain-id`, API base URL, and contract addresses only when you intentionally need a non-default deployment.

2. Verify signer and balances.
- Confirm the signer exists.
- Confirm native BNB gas is available.
- Confirm USD1 balance is sufficient for buy/split flows.

3. Keep selectors clean.
- Use exactly one of `--market-id` or `--market-slug`.
- Use explicit `--outcome-id` when acting on a specific outcome.

## Recommended Workflow

1. Discover markets.
- Start with `myriad ob markets list`.
- Use `myriad ob markets show` for final market inspection.

2. Inspect liquidity before writing.
- Use `myriad ob markets orderbook` for current depth.
- Use `myriad ob markets orderbook --render` for a terminal ladder view.
- Use `myriad ob markets trades` to inspect recent prints and last-price context.

3. Dry-run writes first.
- Use `--dry-run` before any order or position write.

4. Manage the lifecycle after submit.
- Use `myriad ob orders list/show` to inspect status.
- Use `myriad ob orders cancel` for single orders.
- Use `myriad ob orders cancel all --market-id|--market-slug` for market-scoped cleanup.

5. Manage positions explicitly.
- `myriad ob positions list` for portfolio consultation.
- `myriad ob positions split` for collateral -> YES + NO.
- `myriad ob positions merge` for YES + NO -> collateral.
- `myriad ob positions redeem` for settled outcomes.

## Command Patterns

```bash
myriad --chain-id 56 ob markets list --state open --limit 10 --json
```

```bash
myriad --chain-id 56 ob markets orderbook --market-id 42 --outcome-id 0 --render
```

```bash
myriad --chain-id 56 ob limit buy --market-id 42 --outcome-id 0 --price 0.55 --shares 5 --dry-run --json
```

```bash
myriad --chain-id 56 ob market sell --market-id 42 --outcome-id 1 --shares 2 --dry-run --json
```

```bash
myriad --chain-id 56 ob orders cancel all --market-slug will-btc-close-above-120k --dry-run --json
```

## Execution Guidance

- Limit orders:
  Use explicit `--price` and `--shares`; set `--time-in-force` deliberately and add `--expiration` when using GTD-style workflows.
- Market orders:
  Treat `--shares` as the native exact mode.
  Treat `--value` as a best-effort convenience derived from the current book snapshot, not a hard guaranteed spend or proceeds cap.
- Approvals:
  Buy flows need ERC20 allowance.
  Sell flows need ERC1155 approval.

## Failure Handling

- Wrong chain or deployment:
  Re-check chain, API base URL, and order book contract settings before retrying.
- Missing signer:
  Route to `$myriad-wallet-ops`.
- Missing USD1 or gas:
  Top up balances before retrying.
- Missing approvals:
  Re-run with explicit allowance strategy or allow the standard approval flow.
- Insufficient depth:
  Reduce order size, switch to limit pricing, or wait for the book to refill.
- Selector mismatch:
  Keep only one of `--market-id` or `--market-slug`.

## Boundaries

- Do not use `$myriad-trade-execution` for `myriad ob ...`; this skill owns the order book workflow.
- For wallet/keychain repair, hand off to `$myriad-wallet-ops`.
- For MCP sequencing details, hand off to `$myriad-mcp-orchestration`.
